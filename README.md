# Floaty shape
How far can you float?

This project was created by Kallai Hokanson, Jacob Stein, and Zach Tebow for Computer Methods in Physics & Engineering in spring 2018. 

Play floaty shape!
 * Download the zip file using the big green "Download" button
 * Unzip it somewhere
 * Open MATLAB and go to the upzipped folder
 * Type <tt>FloatyShape</tt> in the command window, hit enter, and float!

For best results, move the play window so that it doesn't overlap with the MATLAB window.
